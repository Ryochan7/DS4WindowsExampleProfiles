# DS4Windows Example Profiles Notes

Need to add some notes about what makes some of these profiles unique compared
to the Default created profile. Probably should change the Profile spec to include some
more meta info as well.

## Notes

### Resident Evil 4 (Resident Evil 4.xml)

Profile uses Xbox 360 controller emulation. Gyro Mouse-like Joystick is enabled and
it is bound to Xbox LS with R2 as the Gyro trigger. This allows the Gyro to be used for
aiming while allowing the input stick to be used for movement.
