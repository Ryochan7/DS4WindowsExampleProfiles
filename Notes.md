# DS4Windows Example Profiles Notes

Need to add some notes about what makes some of these profiles unique compared
to the Default created profile. Probably should change the Profile spec to include some
more meta info as well.

## Notes

### Resident Evil 4 (Resident Evil 4.xml)

Profile has Gyro Mouse-like Joystick enabled and bound to Xbox LS with LT as the Gyro
trigger. This allows the Gyro to be used for aiming while allowing the input stick to
be used for movement.
