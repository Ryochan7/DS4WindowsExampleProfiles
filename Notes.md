# DS4Windows Example Profiles Notes

Need to add some notes about what makes some of these profiles unique compared
to the Default created profile. Probably should change the Profile spec to include some
more meta info as well.

## Notes

### American Truck Simulator (ATS.xml)

Profile uses Xbox 360 controller emulation with Accel tilt mapped to Xbox LS
with 360 Gyro Steering Wheel mode enabled. That output mode allows the DS4
to be held with the lightbar pointing up and act closely to a steering wheel for
use in driving games.

### Doom 2016 (Doom 2016 JoyCon.xml)

Profile uses KB+M mapping and is meant to be used with a pair of JoyCon controllers
held split. Gyro (JoyCon R) is mapped to Mouse with a higher dead zone than normal due
to the JoyCon being more naturally shaky (one handed control). The Y button (West) is
used for the Gyro trigger as I find it easier to reach and causes less JoyCon movement.
Shoot is mapped to JoyCon ZL (L2) to not have a primary action cause excessive
Gyro movement for JoyCon R. 1 Euro smoothing is applied to the Gyro.

### Metal: Hellsinger (Hellsinger JoyCon.xml)

Profile uses KB+M mapping and is meant to be used with a pair of JoyCon controllers
held split. Gyro (JoyCon R) is mapped to Mouse with a higher dead zone than normal due
to the JoyCon being more naturally shaky (one handed control). The Y button (West) is
used for the Gyro trigger as I find it easier to reach and causes less JoyCon movement.
Shoot is mapped to JoyCon ZL (L2) to not have a primary action cause excessive
Gyro movement for JoyCon R. 1 Euro smoothing is applied to the Gyro.

### Resident Evil 4 (Resident Evil 4.xml)

Profile uses Xbox 360 controller emulation. Gyro Mouse-like Joystick is enabled and
it is bound to Xbox LS with R2 as the Gyro trigger. This allows the Gyro to be used for
aiming while allowing the input stick to be used for movement.

### Senran Kagura Peach Beach Blast (Peach Beach Blast.xml)

Profile uses Xbox 360 controller emulation. Gyro Mouse-like Joystick is enabled and
it is bound to Xbox RS with Finger on Touchpad acting as a Reverse Gyro trigger.
